 * This accessor function is invoked for each row in a DSV file, being passed

 * replaces the element in the returned array of rows; if the function returns
 * null, the row is stripped from the returned array of rows. In effect, the
 * accessor is similar to applying a map and filter operator to the returned
 * rows. The accessor function is used by parse to convert each row to an object
 * with named attributes.
