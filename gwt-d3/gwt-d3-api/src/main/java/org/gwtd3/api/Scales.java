/**
 * Factory for {@link Scale}s.
 * <p>
 * Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range. There is 3 kind of scales:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Quantitative Scales - for continuous input domains, such as numbers.
 * <li>Ordinal Scales - for discrete input domains, such as names or categories.
 * <li>Time Scales - for time domains. See {@link D3#time()}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Quantitative scales</h2>
 * Quantitative scales have a continuous domain, such as the set of real numbers, or dates. There are also ordinal scales, which have a discrete domain, such as a set of names or
 * categories. Scales are an optional feature in D3; you don't have to use them, if you prefer to do the math yourself. However, using scales can greatly simplify the code needed
 * to map a dimension of data to a visual representation. A scale object, such as that returned by d3.scale.linear, is both an object and a function. That is: you can call the
 * scale like any other function, and the scale has additional methods that change its behavior. Like other classes in D3, scales follow the method chaining pattern where setter
 * methods return the scale itself, allowing multiple setters to be invoked in a concise statement.
 * <p>
